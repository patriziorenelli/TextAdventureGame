Command line game created for a university project.
The game is based on a world, described through its special structure in a txt file. 
The world contains different rooms, links, characters and objects. The rooms each have a name, a list of objects and characters inside.
Links connect two rooms, to use the links you may need objects (such as a key) or take actions to use them.
The objects are of various types, they can be closed and another object may be needed to open them and they can contain objects. 
The characters will be of particular categories ("Guardiano", "Venditore", ...) and can perform specific actions. 
The player will have their own character and will have to search and get the treasure to win the game
I'm sorry but the documentation and comments in the code were written in Italian
